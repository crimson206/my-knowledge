!There is the "Show and tell" category, where we can show off we made!

### 1. **Poetry Community (Includes cleo topics)**

Poetry is the main user and maintainer of cleo. Most cleo-related questions are discussed here.

* GitHub Discussions: [https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/discussions](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/discussions)
* GitHub Issues (cleo included): [https://github.com/python-poetry/cleo/issues](https://github.com/python-poetry/cleo/issues)
* Reddit: [r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python)
* Python Discord (unofficial, general Python help)

### 2. **Python CLI Development Community**

These communities cover CLI development using Python libraries such as `click`, `typer`, `argparse`, `fire`, and `cleo`.

* Reddit:

  * [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython) ! not appropriate for sharing modules
  * [r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python) ! this is better for sharing modules
* Python Discord: [https://discord.gg/python](https://discord.gg/python)

  * Channels like `#help`, `#project-feedback` are useful
* Stack Overflow: Use tags like `[python-cli]`, `[cleo]`, `[click]`, etc.
* GitHub Discussions: Individual libraries often have discussion boards

---

### 3. **General CLI Development Communities (Language-agnostic)**

These focus on CLI tool development across languages like Python, Bash, Go, Rust, etc.

* Dev.to CLI tag: [https://dev.to/t/cli](https://dev.to/t/cli)
* Reddit: [r/commandline](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/)
* Stack Overflow: Use the `[cli]` tag
* Hacker News / Lobsters: Good for discussions and tool announcements
